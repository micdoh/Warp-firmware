# Baseline firmware for the [Warp](https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-hardware) family of hardware platforms
This is the firmware for the [Warp hardware](https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-hardware) and its publicly available and unpublished derivatives. This firmware also runs on the Freescale/NXP FRDM KL03 evaluation board which we use for teaching at the University of Cambridge. When running on platforms other than Warp, only the sensors available in the corresponding hardware platform are accessible.

**Prerequisites:** You need an arm cross-compiler such as `arm-none-eabi-gcc` installed as well as a working `cmake` (installed, e.g., via `apt-get` on Linux or via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) on macOS). On Ubuntu, the package you need is `gcc-arm-none-eabi`. You will also need an installed copy of the SEGGER [JLink commander](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/), `JlinkExe`, which is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows (here are direct links for downloading it for [macOS](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_MacOSX.pkg), and [Linux tgz 64-bit](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_Linux_x86_64.tgz)).

## 1.  Compiling the Warp firmware
First, edit [setup.conf](setup.conf) to set the variable `ARMGCC_DIR` and `JLINKPATH`. If your `arm-none-eabi-gcc` is in `/usr/local/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc`, then you want to set  `ARMGCC_DIR` to `/usr/local`. In the following, this `README.md` will refer to the top of the repository as `$TREEROOT`.

Second, edit [`tools/scripts/glaux.jlink.commands`](tools/scripts/glaux.jlink.commands) and [`tools/scripts/warp.jlink.commands`](tools/scripts/warp.jlink.commands) to replace `<full-path-to-warp-firmware>` with the full path to your Warp firmware directory.

Third, build the Warp firmware by

	make warp

Fourth, load the Warp firmware to hardware by

	make load-warp

To build for the Glaux variant, use `make glaux` and `make load-glaux` in steps three and four instead.

The build process copies files from `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/` into the `build/`, builds, and converts the binary to SREC. See `Warp/src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/README.md` for more. _When editing source, edit the files in `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/`, not the files in `build` location, since the latter are overwritten during each build._

To connect to the running hardware to see output, you will need two terminal windows. In a separate shell window from the one in which you ran `make load-warp` (or its variants), launch the JLink RTT client<sup>&nbsp;<a href="#Notes">See note 1 below</a></sup>:

	JLinkRTTClient

## 2. Using the Warp firmware on the Freescale FRDMKL03 Board
The SEGGER firmware allows you to use SEGGER’s JLink software to load your own firmware to the board, even without using their specialized JLink programming cables. You can find the SEGGER firmware at the SEGGER Page for [OpenSDA firmware](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/other-j-links/opensda-sda-v2/).

To build the Warp firmware for the FRDM KL03, you will need to modify [this line in `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/config.h`](https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-firmware/blob/9e7f9e5e3f3c039cc98cbd1e6dfeb6b8fd78c86a/src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/config.h#L55).


## 3.  Editing the firmware
The firmware is currently all in `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/`, in particular, see `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/warp-kl03-ksdk1.1-boot.c` and the per-sensor drivers in `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/dev*.[c,h]`.

The firmware builds on the Kinetis SDK. You can find more documentation on the Kinetis SDK in the document [doc/Kinetis SDK v.1.1 API Reference Manual.pdf](https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-firmware/blob/master/doc/Kinetis%20SDK%20v.1.1%20API%20Reference%20Manual.pdf).

The firmware is designed for the Warp and Glaux hardware platforms, but will also run on the Freescale FRDM KL03 development board. In that case, the only sensor driver which is relevant is the one for the MMA8451Q. For more details about the structure of the firmware, see [src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/README.md](src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/README.md).

### Notes
<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; On some Unix platforms, the `JLinkRTTClient` has a double echo of characters you type in. You can prevent this by configuring your terminal program to not echo the characters you type. To achieve this on `bash`, use `stty -echo` from the terminal. Alternatively, rather than using the `JLinkRTTClient`, you can use a `telnet` program: `telnet localhost 19021`. This avoids the JLink RTT Client's "double echo" behavior but you will then need a carriage return (&crarr;) for your input to be sent to the board.

# Heart Rate Monitor
This is a heart rate monitoring application developed for the FRDM KL03 evaluation board. It is built on a stripped-down version of the [Warp firmware](https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-firmware) developed by the University of Cambridge's [Physical Computation Laboratory](http://physcomp.eng.cam.ac.uk).

## Building the application

**Prerequisites:** You need an arm cross-compiler such as `arm-none-eabi-gcc` installed as well as a working `cmake` (installed, e.g., via `apt-get` on Linux or via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on macOS). You will also need an installed copy of the SEGGER [JLink commander](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/), `JlinkExe`, which is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows (here are direct links for downloading it for [macOS](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_MacOSX.pkg), and [Linux tgz 64-bit](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_Linux_x86_64.tgz)).

### 1. Compiling the application
The steps here are drawn from the compilation of the [Warp firmware](https://github.com/physical-computation/Warp-hardware).

First, specify the full path to the `bin` directory of your arm cross-compiler in the environment variable `ARMGCC_DIR` by changing line 3 of `build/ksdk1.1/build.sh`:

	export ARMGCC_DIR=<full-path-to-arm-cross-compiler>

Second, specify the full path to the application directory so that JLink can correctly locate the binary output file by changing line 3 of `tools/scripts/jlink.commands`:

	loadfile <full-path-to-application>/build/ksdk1.1/work/demos/Warp/armgcc/Warp/release/Warp.srec

Then you should be able to compile the application with:

	cd build/ksdk1.1/
	./build.sh

This copies the files from `Warp/src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/` into the KSDK tree, builds, and converts the binary to SREC. _When editing source, edit the files in `Warp/src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/`, not the files in the build location, since the latter are overwritten during each build._

### 2. Pin configuration
The following pins on the FRDM KL03 evaluation board are connected to an [SSD1331 OLED display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/684) and a [MAX30105 IR sensor](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/max30105-breakout-heart-rate-oximeter-smoke-sensor):

OLED display:
```
BOARD		DISPLAY
3.3V	->	VCC
GND	->	GND
PTA8	->	MOSI
PTA9	->	SCK
PTB13	->	OCS
PTA12	->	D/C
PTB0	->	RST

```

IR sensor:
```
BOARD		IR SENSOR
3.3V	->	VCC
GND	->	GND
PTB3	->	I2C SCL
PTB4	->	I2C SDA
PTA7	->	INTERRUPT
```

### 3. Loading the application onto the evaluation board
Run the firmware downloader:

	JLinkExe -device MKL03Z32XXX4 -if SWD -speed 100000 -CommanderScript ../../tools/scripts/jlink.commands

## Source File Descriptions
The core of the application is in `src/boot/ksdk1.1.0/boot.c`. The drivers for the display are in `devSSD1331.c` and for the sensors in `devMMA8451Q.c`, `devL3GD20H.c` `devINA219.c`, respectively. The section below briefly describes all the source files in this directory.
